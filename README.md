# baygent-skills

A set of skills to call your agent Bayes. Thomas Bayes.

[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) for Bayesian modeling, causal inference, and probabilistic thinking. Compatible with Claude Code, Kimi Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and any agent that supports the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification).

## Available skills

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| [bayesian-workflow](bayesian-workflow/) | Full Bayesian modeling workflow with PyMC and ArviZ. Full breakdown [here](https://learnbayesstats.com/blog-posts/bayesian-workflow-agent-skill-pymc-arviz). |

More skills coming soon. Issues and PRs are welcome!

## Quick install

### Claude Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Learning-Bayesian-Statistics/baygent-skills.git /tmp/baygent-skills
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -r /tmp/baygent-skills/bayesian-workflow ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Other compatible agents

Clone the repo and copy the skill folder you need into your agent's skills location:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Learning-Bayesian-Statistics/baygent-skills.git /tmp/baygent-skills
cp -r /tmp/baygent-skills/bayesian-workflow/ ~/.config/agents/skills/bayesian-workflow/
```

## Philosophy

These skills are **opinionated and workflow-first**. They don't just teach an agent what PyMC functions exist — they enforce a specific sequence of steps (prior predictive checks, diagnostics, calibration, reporting) and guardrails (94% HDI, reproducible seeds, save-to-disk) that produce reliable analyses.

Each skill is focused and lean. Rather than one monolithic skill that covers everything, we build specialized skills that do one thing well:

- **bayesian-workflow** covers the fundamentals that every Bayesian analysis needs.
